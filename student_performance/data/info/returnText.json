"Solar System": {
	"Weak": "The Solar system consists of 8 planets and the Sun , which move around the sun and the sun rotates on its own. All the planets and the sun also rotate on their own. The planets are namely, Mercury, Venus, Earth , Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune."
	"Average": "The Solar System consists of 8 planets and the Sun, the planets rotate and revolve about the sun in their respective orbits, and the planets in their respective order of increasing distance from the sun are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune."
	"Intelligent": "The Solar System is gravitationally bound planetary system of the Sun and the objects that orbit the Sun, either directly or indirectly. Of the objects that revolve around the Sun are 8 planets namely Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, with the remainder being smaller objects, such as five dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies."

"Atom":{
	"Weak": "An atom is the smallest component of the object, and are buliding blocks of all matter. It consists of electrons, neutrons and protons."
	"Average": "The smallest particle of a chemical element that can exist. An atom consists of a nucleus which is formed by positively charged particles called protons, negatively charged particles called neutrons and neutral particles called neutrons.
	"Intelligent": "The atom is the smallest object that retains the properties of an element. Atoms are composed of electrons and a nucleus. The nucleus contains protons and neutrons. All atoms are electrically neutral, because every atom has an equal number of electrons and protons. Nearly all of the atom's mass is located in the nucleus"

"Rutherford Model":{
	"Weak": "the Rutherford model of the atom is the classic model of the atom, even though it's no longer considered an accurate representation. Rutherford's model shows that an atom is mostly empty space, with electrons orbiting a fixed, positively charged nucleus in set, predictable paths."

"Bohr Model ":{
	"Weak": "Bohr’s Model of an atom The electrons move around in a predictable path called orbits. Bohr modified Rutherford’s model where he explained that electrons move around in fixed orbital shells."

"Ethane Structure":{
	"Weak": "At standard temperature and pressure, ethane is a colorless, odorless gas, and it is represented as CH4 .Related compounds may be formed by replacing a hydrogen atom with another functional group."

"Thomson Model":{
	"Weak": "Thomson atomic model, earliest theoretical description of the inner structure of atoms, proposed about 1904 by J J Thomson. Thomson held that atoms are uniform spheres of positively charged matter in which electrons are embedded. Popularly known as the plum pudding model, it had to be abandoned (1911) on both theoretical and experimental grounds in favour of the Rutherford atomic model, in which the electrons describe orbits about a tiny positive nucleus."

"Plant Cell":{
	"Weak": "Plant cells are  eukaryotic cells present in green plants, photosynthetic eukaryotes of the kingdom Plantae. Their distinctive features include primary cell walls containing cellulose, hemicelluloses and pectin, the presence of plastids with the capability to perform photosynthesis and store starch"

"Mitochondria":{
	"Weak": "Mitochondria are the working organelles that keep the cell full of energy. Mitochondria are small organelles floating free throughout the cell. Some cells have several thousandmitochondria while others have none. Muscle cells need a lot of energy so they have loads of mitochondria."

"Magnetic Field":{
	"Weak": "Significant forces are acting between current-carrying wires, since ordinary currents produce significant magnetic fields and these fields exert significant forces on ordinary currents. Once the magnetic field has been calculated, the magnetic force expression can be used to calculate the force. The direction is obtained from the right hand thumb rule. It should be noted that two wires carrying current in the same direction attract each other, and they repel if the direction of flow of current is opposite."
